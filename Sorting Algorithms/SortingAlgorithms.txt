Here's a tabular format listing various sorting algorithms along with their average and worst-case time complexity:

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sorting Algorithm | Average Time Complexity| Worst-Case Time Complexity |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Bubble Sort       | O(n^2)                 | O(n^2)                     |
| Selection Sort    | O(n^2)                 | O(n^2)                     |
| Insertion Sort    | O(n^2)                 | O(n^2)                     |
| Merge Sort        | O(n log n)             | O(n log n)                 |
| Quick Sort        | O(n log n)             | O(n^2)                     |
| Heap Sort         | O(n log n)             | O(n log n)                 |
| Radix Sort        | O(nk)                  | O(nk)                      |
| Counting Sort     | O(n+k)                 | O(n+k)                     |
| Bucket Sort       | O(n^2)                 | O(n^2)                     |

Note: 
- "n" represents the number of elements in the input array.
- "k" represents the range of values in the input array.

Please keep in mind that these time complexities represent the typical cases for the algorithms. 
In some scenarios, certain algorithms may exhibit better or worse performance depending on the data 
distribution and other factors.
